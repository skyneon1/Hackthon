It is a chronic condition that causes dry, itchy, and inflamed skin, and it's possible for it to be triggered by various factors such as allergies, stress, or environmental changes. 

To manage your symptoms, I would recommend keeping your skin well-moisturized with a gentle, fragrance-free lotion, avoiding harsh soaps and detergents, and wearing loose, breathable clothing to reduce irritation. You may also want to try using cool compresses or taking an oral antihistamine to help alleviate itching and reduce inflammation. If your symptoms persist or worsen, it's best to consult a dermatologist for further evaluation and treatment.",2025-04-12 06:19:12.139251
